                <p>
                    Welcome to ePITsolutions web Sites and eLearning web Sites (<a href="http://www.epitsolutions.org" target="_blank">www.epitsolutions.org</a> and

                    <a href="http://www.epitsolutions.elmg.net" target="_blank">www.epitsolutions.elmg.net</a> ) (hereafter the "Sites").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please read this Terms and Conditions of Use carefully before using these Sites. By using the Sites,

you accept and agree to the terms and conditions contained hereunder. If you do not agree to

these terms and conditions (the "Terms"), please do not use the Sites. We may change the Terms

from time to time, and it is your responsibility to review them periodically to make sure that you

are current on the guidelines.
                </p>
                <h2>General</h2>
                

                <p>These Sites are operated by ePITsolutions Limited. The Sites offer Users (as defined below) access

to information, resources and other content assets owned or licensed by ePITsolutions Limited.</p>

                <p>Please note that all visitors and members in any category will be referred to hereafter as "User" in

this Agreement.</p>

                <p>Each User must be 18 years or older to establish a "Member Profile". "Member Profile" means the

account (the "Account") registered to any User pursuant to the registration procedures for the

Sites. The Terms of this Agreement apply to all Users. The User for any Member Profile Account is

entirely liable for all activities conducted through that Account.</p>

                <h2>Personal Information</h2>

                <p>When you register yourself or your organisation as a Member of ePITsolutions Limited web Sites,

you must provide the requested contact information and general information about you and your

organisation. We will also ask you to create a Username and Password. This information allows us

to maintain a Member Profile for each Member so that we have a better understanding of the

needs of our Members. It helps us prioritise the development of our ePracticing offer to your

needs. It also helps us adjust our services to your expectations and report your improvement

requests to our partners.</p>

                <p>We may use the information we collect during the registration process to occasionally notify you

about important functionality changes to the websites and new ePracticing developped by

ePITsolutions Limited.</p>

                <h2>Non-transferability of Membership</h2>

                <p>As a registered Member of these Sites, ePITsolutions Limited grants you a personal, non-exclusive,

non-assignable, and non-transferable license to use and display the information offered by the

Sites on any machine(s) of which you are the primary user. You acknowledge that you may not

sublicense, transfer, sell, or assign this license or the Sites without written authorisation from

ePITsolutions Limited. Any attempt to sublicense, transfer, sell, loan, or assign the license may

result in its immediate termination.</p>
                    

                <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

                <p>The Sites provide certain Sites and benefits for registered Members and derive their revenue from

the production and distribution of those Sites and benefits for the exclusive use of registered 

Members. Users of the Sites acknowledge that the duplication and/or redistribution of content,

information, data, or other intellectual property gained through exclusive access to the Sites to

any other party would be a violation of applicable copyright laws and therefore would cause harm

to the Sites. Members hereby agree that duplication and/or redistribution of any materials to any

non-member shall require prior written authorisation from a director of ePITsolutions. It is further

agreed, that any specific instance in which written authorisation is granted by the Sites, does not

authorise the Member to duplicate and/or redistribute any other material than that for which

written authorisation was granted.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>

                <p>As part of the registration process each Member will select a Username and Password. You shall

provide ePITsolutions Limited with accurate, complete, and updated information. You agree to

notify ePITsolutions Limited by email at <a href="mailto:contact@epitsolutions.org" target="_blank">contact@epitsolutions.org</a> of any known or suspected

unauthorised use(s) of your User Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including

loss, theft, or unauthorised disclosure of your Username and/or Password. You shall be

responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Password. Any fraudulent, abusive, or

otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your User Account, at ePITsolution's

sole discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate statutory authorities.</p>

                <h2>Personal Information Security</h2>

                <p>ePITsolutions Limited implements a variety of standard web security measures to maintain the

safety and security of your personal information. Of course any User who has not registered as a

Member may use the Sites anonymously as a visitor, but any personal information you provide to

become a Registered Member will be protected by secured networks and is only accessible by a

limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. We recommend

that, if you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public (i.e., a

University or library, etc.), you remember to close your browser window when you have finished

your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.</p>

                <h2>Personal Information to Other Parties</h2>

                <p>ePITsolutions Limited does not sell or otherwise transfer email addresses or other general

information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration process. This information is

collected and used to better understand Users' use of the Sites and to support related transactions

made on the Sites. ePITsolutions Limited may also use email addresses and other personally

identifiable information to communicate with Users who initiate communications with

ePITsolutions Limited.</p>

                <p>ePITsolutions Limited may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good

faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a court order or other

legal process. We may also disclose this information if we have reason to believe that disclosing

this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may

be violating our terms of Sites or to protect the safety of our Users and the public.</p>

                <h2>Cookies</h2>

                <p>Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a User's hard drive to help

tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the Sites. Cookies allow websites operators to better

customise Sites visits to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the

Internet and most major websites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept

cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a

cookie. This gives you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. The Sites will attempt

to install a cookie to your browser that will enable it to recognise you whenever you return to the

Sites. This action will expedite your access of various members benefits and materials. If you

choose not to allow the Sites cookie to be installed to your browser, please be aware that you may

have difficulty accessing some content assets.</p>

                <h2>Termination of Membership</h2>

                <p>ePITsolution's membership is effective until terminated by either party. Paid memberships are

effective until they expire, at which time they are terminated by either party. Although it is

assumed that all memberships will remain active for one year, you may terminate your

membership and your right to use the Sites at any time by sending a letter to ePITsolutions Limited

on your company letterhead, stating your reasons for terminating. ePITsolutions Limited may

terminate your account or access rights to these Sites immediately without notice, if in

ePITsolutions's sole discretion, you fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement.

ePITsolutions Limited may terminate the Sites, or any element of the Sites, at any time without

notice. Refunds will not be issued for cancelled or terminated memberships.</p>

                <h2>Third Party Links</h2>

                <p>In an attempt to provide increased value to Users, ePITsolutions Limited may provide various third

party websites links from this websites. However, even if the third party is affiliated with

ePITsolutions Limited, ePITsolutions Limited has no control over these linked Sites who may each

have separate privacy and data collection practices, and which are independent of ePITsolutions

Limited. Neither ePITsolutions Limited nor any of its affiliates and contractors, have any

responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and no such party is responsible

for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. These linked Sites are only for your

convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, ePITsolutions Limited

seeks to protect the integrity of its websites and the links placed upon it and therefore requests

feedback on not only its own Sites, but for Sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does

not work).</p>

                <h2>Solicitation and Advertising</h2>

                <p>You may not use these Sites to send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms

of solicitation to other users.</p>

direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss and/or damages arising out of (i) the use

by such user of any browser owned or operated by any third party and/or (ii) the downloading of

any software owned or operated by any third party.</p>

                <h2>Monitoring</h2>

                <p>We shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of the Sites to determine

compliance with this Agreement and any other operating rules. We shall have the right in our sole

discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on the Sites.

Without limiting the foregoing, we shall have the right to remove any material that we, in our sole

discretion, find to be in breach of the provisions hereof or, otherwise objectionable.

Notwithstanding this right, Users shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages.

provider shall assume or have any liability for any action or inaction by ePITsolutions Limited or

any third party content provider with respect to any conduct, communication or posting on the
